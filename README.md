** MOVIE RECOMMENDATON API **

This project is a movie recommendation system built with Scikit-Learn for model building, Flask as a web framework, and Heroku for deployment.
The API recommends movies based on user preferences.

Definition: Content-Based recommendation works on the principle that if a user likes a certain item then we recommend the user a similar item based on the item’s features or attributes. So in our case, if a user likes a movie of a particular genre or an actor then we recommend a movie on similar lines to our user. So, if a user has watched the movie Joker then our recommendation system would predict movies similar to Joker or with the same cast as that of Joker if we consider the movie’s cast
